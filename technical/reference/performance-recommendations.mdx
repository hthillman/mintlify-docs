A pipeline must pass pre-deployment tests before it can be published to Livepeer

Before deployment, we conduct a 30s test using the Big Buck Bunny mp4. This test will fail if:

* Any exception occurs&#x20;

* Output Frames-per-second (FPS) degrades from input FPS by 80% or more (`(input FPS / output FPS) < 0.2`)

  * 20% - 80% degradation is consider suboptimal and will incur a warning, but will pass pre-deployment tests

  * \< 20% degradation is considered good, but developers should strive for \~0% degradation
