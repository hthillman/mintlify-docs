Pipeline pricing follows a transparent, usage-based model that reflects the Livepeer network's open marketplace. This guide explains how pricing works and what to expect when using pipelines in your applications.

## The Basics

You pay only for the time your streams use a pipeline. Pricing is calculated per minute of video processed, with costs starting when a stream connects and ending when it disconnects. It is scaled by pixels, so if you use a high-res video you will incur greater costs.

```
Total Cost = Minutes Streamed × Pixel Multiplier x Pipeline Rate
```

## Infrastructure Providers

Pipelines run on a network of infrastructure providers (called Orchestrators). Each provider can set their own rates for running specific pipelines. When you start a stream, we automatically select the most cost-effective provider that meets your pipeline's performance requirements.

In the future, you will be able choose a specific provider if you prefer. This might be useful if you:

* Need guaranteed infrastructure in specific regions

* Want to maintain consistent pricing

* Have compliance requirements

## Who Sets Prices

Orchestrators set their own pricing. Gateways route jobs to Orchestrators for a small fee.

## How Pipeline Rates Work

Pipeline rates are determined by two factors:

1. **Base Compute Cost**: The actual infrastructure cost to run the pipeline, set by Orchestrators

2. **Gateway Fee**: A small fee for managing infrastructure and ensuring reliability

Each pipeline displays its current rate before you start streaming. This rate is guaranteed not to exceed the displayed amount during your stream.

## Pricing Example

Let's say you're using a style transfer pipeline that costs $0.10 per minute:

```
1 hour stream = 60 minutes × $0.10 x (1.0 multiplier for 720p stream) = $6.00
1 hour stream = 60 minutes × $0.10 x (3.0 multiplier for 1080p stream) = $18.00
```

## Current Pricing 

Right now, pipeline pricing is split into three tiers by overall resource usage:
- High resource: complex pipelines that take 16-24 GB VRAM. Ex: SAM2 + Stream Diffusion.
  - **Price:** $1.50 / hr
- Medium resource: pipelines that take 8 - 16 GB VRAM. Ex: DepthAnything
  - **Price:** $1.00 / hr
- Low resource: pipelines that take less than 8 GB VRAM. Ex: LivePortrait, SAM2, etc
  - **Price:** $0.50 / hr

Over time, we will shift to fully marketplace-based pricing

## Free Trial

All new accounts start with $10 in credit to help you test pipelines in production. No credit card required.

## [temporary] Free Credit Refills

During initial rollout, Livepeer will subsidize all credit refills. To prevent abuse of this system, you may not carry a balance greater than $250.

## Managing Costs

Right now, you will need to manage your own costs. In Q1, we will begin rolling out a suite of features to help you understand and control your spend.

These will include:

### Usage Monitoring

* View real-time cost accumulation in the dashboard

* Set spending alerts and limits

* Export detailed usage reports

### Cost Control

* Test pipelines with our free tier (5 minutes per pipeline per day)

* Set maximum spending limits per stream

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I run out of funds?**
A: Your streams will continue if you have automatic refills enabled. Otherwise, they'll be paused until you add more funds. -->

<!-- **Q: Can pricing change during a stream?**
A: Yes. However, if you choose the "Best match" provider selection option, it is guaranteed that your rate will not *increase*.

If you choose to run a pipeline with a specific Livepeer orchestrator, the rate you see when starting a stream is guaranteed for its duration unless the orchestrator fails. In that case, the stream will fall back to the "Best match" option as described above. -->
